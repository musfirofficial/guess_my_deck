          In this card game, both players and the computer are initially dealt
          three cards each. The first card can have a value of up to 3, while
          the second and third cards can have values of up to 5 and 7,
          respectively(both computer's and players). Players have the
          flexibility to choose any number of cards from their deck.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          If a player's card totals 8, they secure a victory in that round.
          However, if a player's card exceeds 8, they automatically lose the
          round. In the event that a player's total card points fall below 8,
          they can challenge the computer's cards.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          At first, player's points are compared with the combined points of the
          computer's first two cards. If player's points lower or equal, then
          player lose the round, even if computer's third card could push the
          total above 8(read next rule for more)
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          If a player's points exceed the total points of the computer's three
          cards, they win the round. Conversely, if a player's points are lower
          than the computer's points and the computer's total is less than 8,
          the player loses the round. Lastly, if the computer's three-card total
          exceeds 8, victory is awarded to the player.
        </li>

          Your current deck value is the reward score and winner will add it
          with their total scores. The player who get 100 scores first is
          winner.
