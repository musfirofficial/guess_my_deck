## How to play

- In this card game, both players and the computer are initially dealt three cards each. The first card can have a value of up to 3, while the second and third cards can have values of up to 5 and 7, respectively(both computer's and players). Players have the flexibility to choose any number of cards from their deck.
- If a player's card totals 8, they secure a victory in that round. However, if a player's card exceeds 8, they automatically lose the round. In the event that a player's total card points fall below 8, they can challenge the computer's cards.
- At first, player's points are compared with the combined points of the computer's first two cards. If player's points lower or equal, then player lose the round, even if computer's third card could push the total above 8(read next rule for more)
- If a player's points exceed the total points of the computer's three cards, they win the round. Conversely, if a player's points are lower than the computer's points and the computer's total is less than 8, the player loses the round. Lastly, if the computer's three-card total exceeds 8, victory is awarded to the player.
- Your current deck value is the reward score and winner will add it with their total scores. The player who get 100 scores first is winner.
